CS 121 and CS 122 are prerequisites to upper-level courses in Computer Science and must be taken before upper-level course can be attempted. Placement above CS 121/CS 122 for incoming students is done either by AP exam credit or through discussion with the course instructor and the Dean.
MA121 and MA 122 are required of Computer Science majors, and should be taken in the first year, if possible. A student who achieved a score of 4 or better on the College Board Advanced Placement Calculus AB Examination should be placed MA 122 in the first semester. Credit will be given for MA 121. A student who achieved a score of 4 or better on the College Board Advanced Placement Calculus BC Examination receives credits for both MA 121 and for MA 122.
A C- or better is required to advance from MA 121 to MA 122.
