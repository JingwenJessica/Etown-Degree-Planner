CPA Certification/150-Hour Accounting Program
In order to become licensed as a certified public accountant (CPA), most states now require individuals to complete 150 credits of course work in addition to obtaining a bachelor’s degree and passing the CPA exam. For those students planning to pursue this certification, the student’s advisor will work with them to develop an individual plan to earn 150 credits that incorporates their state’s specific requirements. Most students are able to complete the additional credits within their four years at Elizabethtown through a combination of AP credits, additional semester courses, internships, and/or summer courses. Alternatively, students wishing to pursue a master’s degree can obtain the additional credit hours as part of their course of study in their master’s program. Several colleges and universities have developed one-year master’s degree programs for students who wish to pursue this option.

Program Opportunities
Program facilities and the Media Center are located in the Steinman Center for Communications and Fine Arts. This Center contains modern equipment in audio and video studios, and graphics and multi-image laboratories. The student-operated media stations, WWEC 88.3 FM and ECTV Channel 40, and the student-run newspaper, the Etownian, are housed in the Center. The Program also operates a citizen journalism news website, www.wetown.org.
The curriculum is complemented by a number of programmatic organizations: WWEC-FM radio, Photography Club, Society for Collegiate Journalists (honorary society), the Jay Firm (student public relations agency), ECTV-40, and others. The Etownian provides excellent journalism experiences for majors. These organizations sponsor speakers, workshops, contests, and field trips to enhance campus life while making the student’s classroom experience more meaningful.
Internships and Practica
Out-of-classroom, on-the-job field experiences are encouraged of all majors and minors. An experience linking the academic world and the work world can enable an advanced student to apply – in a practical way – understandings and abilities in a career-related position. Practica may be elected by majors and minors at the sophomore level and above and are available for zero, one, two, or three semester credits with on- or off-campus sponsors. Board members of ECTV and WWEC may also receive a one-credit practicum experience. Practicum experiences are repeatable to a maximum of four credits and may count only as general elective credit. Internship credits also count only as general elective credits. They are available only to seniors and must be taken only for 12 semester credits (requiring the internship to be the equivalent of a full-time position for an entire semester). Additionally, the internship option requires an overall 2.70 grade point average and a 3.00 grade point average in the major. The Program’s “Guide to the Preparation of Internships” serves as an outline of procedures and requirements for an internship. Students are permitted to seek their own positions for either option (practicum or internship) or to apply for one from the many opportunities already listed with regional communications organizations.
GPA Requirement
All students must have a 2.00 grade point average to declare the major or minor and enroll in any courses above the 100 level.

OT students must achieve a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.9 by the end of the junior year to be admitted into the OT graduate degree program.
Students, in conjunction with their academic advisor, must also complete an essay to capture their professional development over their academic career. The purpose of this essay is to identify professional growth goals for entry-level practice. No student will be excluded from the graduate program based on the essay. If the composition does not meet the required expectations, repeated drafts guided by the academic advisor may be necessary. Essays are due at the end of the junior year to the Program Director by May 1.

Students must declare a major of study by the beginning of their sophomore year (second year) and transfer students (internal or from other institutions) must declare a major of study. Declaring the major late could result in students taking additional semesters of study to complete course work in proper sequence. Prerequisite courses must be taken in advance of courses, NOT as co-requisites. Although not required, a minor course of study is recommended by the Program advisors.
COM 145 will fulfill the Public Relations elective requirement and the Creative Expression requirement of the Core program.
COM 180 will fulfill the Public Relations elective requirement and the Social Sciences requirement of the Core program.
COM 252 will fulfill the Public Relations elective requirement and the Humanities requirement of the Core program.
Program Opportunities
Program facilities and the Media Center are located in the Steinman Center for Communications and Fine Arts. This Center contains modern equipment in audio and video studios, and graphics and multi-image laboratories. The student-operated media stations, WWEC 88.3 FM and ECTV Channel 40, and the student-run newspaper, the Etownian, are housed in the Center. The Program also operates a citizen journalism news website, www.wetown.org.
The curriculum is complemented by a number of programmatic organizations: WWEC-FM radio, Photography Club, Society for Collegiate Journalists (honorary society), the Jay Firm (student public relations agency), ECTV-40, and others. The Etownian provides excellent journalism experiences for majors. These organizations sponsor speakers, workshops, contests, and field trips to enhance campus life while making the student’s classroom experience more meaningful.
Internships and Practica
Out-of-classroom, on-the-job field experiences are encouraged of all majors and minors. An experience linking the academic world and the work world can enable an advanced student to apply – in a practical way – understandings and abilities in a career-related position. Practica may be elected by majors and minors at the sophomore level and above and are available for zero, one, two, or three semester credits with on- or off-campus sponsors. Board members of ECTV and WWEC may also receive a one-credit practicum experience. Practicum experiences are repeatable to a maximum of four credits and may count only as general elective credit. Internship credits also count only as general elective credits. They are available only to seniors and must be taken only for 12 semester credits (requiring the internship to be the equivalent of a full-time position for an entire semester). Additionally, the internship option requires an overall 2.70 grade point average and a 3.00 grade point average in the major. The Program’s “Guide to the Preparation of Internships” serves as an outline of procedures and requirements for an internship. Students are permitted to seek their own positions for either option (practicum or internship) or to apply for one from the many opportunities already listed with regional communications organizations.
GPA Requirement
All students must have a 2.00 grade point average to declare the major or minor and enroll in any courses above the 100 level.
